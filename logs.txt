🧠 Agent Response: FUNCTION_CALL: summarize|Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs, similar to a USB-C port for AI. It facilitates building agents and workflows on top of LLMs by providing pre-built integrations, flexibility in LLM providers, and data security best practices. MCP uses a client-server architecture with hosts, clients, and servers connecting local data sources and remote services. The site provides quick starts for server and client developers and Claude Desktop users, examples of servers and clients, tutorials on building and debugging MCP, and resources to explore core concepts. It also provides guidance on contributing, support, and feedback.

MCP uses a client-server architecture where host applications (like Claude Desktop) connect to MCP Servers exposing data from local or remote sources via MCP Clients. It offers pre-built integrations, vendor flexibility, and data security best practices. Resources are available for server/client developers and Claude Desktop users, including quick starts, examples, tutorials, and a debugging inspector. Contributions and feedback are welcomed through GitHub issues and discussions.
